## Prerequisites

Before diving into this firmware workshop, make sure you have the necessary software installed on your machine. We'll be using MicroPython to program the Raspberry Pi Pico Firmware, and Thonny IDE will be our tool of choice to facilitate this process.

### Why Thonny?

Thonny is a Python-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a user-friendly interface for programming and running MicroPython on various microcontroller boards, including the Raspberry Pi Pico.

### Step 1: Install Thonny

1. **Download Thonny:** Start by downloading the latest version of Thonny for your operating system from the official Thonny website: [Thonny Download](https://thonny.org/).

2. **Installation:** Run the installation wizard and follow the on-screen instructions to install Thonny on your machine. As a part of the IDE installation, it will also install its own version of Python (as of September 2023, it installs Python 3.10).

3. **Launch Thonny:** After installation, launch Thonny. It should open with a welcoming interface similar to the screenshot below:

Now that you have Thonny installed, you're ready to start working with the Raspberry Pi Pico Firmware in our workshop.
